### What is iGIVit?
With iGIVit, we aim to create a completely integrated solution for giving better by providing the tools to deliver financial assistance and/or emergency relief to the people and communities in need. We aim to restore trust in charities and bring philanthropy to the 21st century by building a decentralized app allowing donors to follow funds' usage and for charities to create and manage their campaigns with more transparency and accountability.
